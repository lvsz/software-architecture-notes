# Allocation structures
##
Allocation structures show the **relationship between the software elements** and **elements in one or more external environments** in which the software is **created**, and **executed**.

### Elements
* Software element & environmental element
* A **software element** has properties that are required of the environment
* An **environmental element** has properties that are provided to the software
### Relations
*  allocated-to:
  - a software element is mapped (or allocated) to an environmental element
  - properties are dependent on the particular view
  <!-- ??? -->
### Constraints
*  Vary by view

## Example allocation views
### Deployment view

### Install view
